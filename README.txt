This is a defualt animation template, Load this .blend in blender then hit file > defualts > save startup file.
to reset it hit file > defualts > load factory settings.
i left the default cube in because its fun to delete lol
note: by defualt this is set to 60 fps eevee and there are no render options set. this template will probably get some updates over time (maybe). 

if you think something should be changed feal free to dm me on discord ピアース#0412
